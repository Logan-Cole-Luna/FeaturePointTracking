TODO

Implement a system that, when the tracked points are detected within a bounding box after time T, the object
within the bbox will be assigned the label that the points detected within the box already have

EX:
Plane 1 is lost, redetected later as plane 3, plane 1 points are still attached, so plane 3 is renamed plane 1

Purpose:
Ensure that there will not be an ever increasing number of objects and points not connecting to object they came from

TODO

Create a confidence metric where if points within a specified radius R of a track point are matched near it after X
frames, they will receive the same label as that point
Treat new points differently, be careful not to clone plane

EX:
Plane 1 has lost detection and has switched to points and Point 1 is tracked, after X frames Point 2 which was not
 originally detected with Plane 1 has remained withing radius R of Point 1, then Point 2 is given the same label as
 Point 1 (Plane 1)

Purpose:
Prevent points from dying out after a long period of no detections

TODO

Handling of multiple objects
Ideas:
- Implement idea #1 first along with each object having it's own points, should asist with overall tracking
- For loop that iterates through every object in frame and attaches points to labels & matches points

TODO

If points of same object such as plane_1 go x distance from one another, then points of lower cluster density will be removed

TODO

Create of confidence prediction that utilizes YOLO and Point Location to draw bounding box

TODO

Integration of Kalman Filter, the Kalman filter will predict the object's
future state (e.g., position and velocity) based on its current state and past movements.

Would address the overlapping objects problem

TODO

Store all data, what tracked, when detected, when lost, when redetected
